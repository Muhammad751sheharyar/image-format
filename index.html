    <h1>Image format Assignment</h1>
    <h2>jpg Image format</h2>
    <p ><img src="Image/download (1).jpg" alt="" height="150px" width="" align="left">
    The **JPG (or JPEG)** image format is one of the most widely used formats for digital images. It uses **lossy compression**, which reduces file size while maintaining good image quality. This makes it ideal for **photographs, web graphics, and digital artwork** where small file sizes are important. However, repeated editing and saving of JPG images can degrade quality due to compression. It supports **millions of colors** but does not support transparency like PNG. Overall, JPG is perfect for sharing images online and storing high-quality photos with efficient file sizes.</p><br>

    <h2>png Image format</h2>
    <p ><img src="Image/images.png" alt="" align="right">The PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format is a widely used lossless compression format for images. It supports a wide range of colors and allows transparency, making it ideal for web graphics, logos, and images that require high detail. Unlike formats like JPEG, PNG does not lose any image quality during compression, ensuring that every pixel retains its original sharpness. Additionally, PNG images are often used for images with text or sharp edges due to their clarity and precision.</p><br><br><br>

    <h2>SVG Image format</h2>
    <p ><img src="Image/123.svg" alt="" align="top">SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based image format that uses vector graphics to define shapes, lines, colors, and text. Unlike raster formats like JPEG or PNG, SVG images are resolution-independent, meaning they can be scaled infinitely without losing quality. This makes them ideal for web graphics, logos, and illustrations that need to appear crisp on any screen size or resolution. SVG files are lightweight, easy to edit with text editors, and can be manipulated directly through CSS or JavaScript, making them highly interactive and dynamic. Due to their text-based nature, SVG files are also easily searchable, indexable, and accessible for web development and SEO purposes.</p><hr>
    <h2>WebP Image format</h2>
    <p><img src="Image/download-_2_.webp" alt="" align="bottom">WebP is a modern image format developed by Google that provides both lossy and lossless compression, allowing for smaller file sizes while maintaining high image quality. It supports a wide range of features, including transparency (like PNG) and animation (like GIF), making it a versatile choice for web developers. WebP images are particularly beneficial for improving website performance by reducing page load times, as they typically offer better compression rates than traditional formats like JPEG and PNG. Its support across most modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, has made WebP increasingly popular for optimizing images in web design. Additionally, WebPâ€™s ability to maintain high visual quality with smaller file sizes helps in enhancing user experience and SEO by speeding up content delivery.</p>

    <h2>gif Image format</h2>
    <p><img src="Image/a3e486a7d678c7bc9673d24b0b2092f9.gif" alt="" align="left" height="150px">The GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a popular image format known for its ability to support both static and animated images. It uses lossless compression, meaning the image quality is preserved without any data loss. GIFs are widely used for short animations or simple graphics due to their ability to display a sequence of images in a looping manner. One of the key features of the GIF format is its support for transparency, allowing images to have a transparent background. However, GIFs are limited to a color palette of 256 colors, which can reduce the richness of images compared to other formats like JPEG or PNG. Despite this limitation, the format's simplicity, widespread support across browsers and platforms, and ease of use in web design and social media have made it a ubiquitous choice for sharing animated visuals.</p>
